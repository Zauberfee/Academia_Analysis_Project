    "**Attempts: <br>**\n",
    "- Advanced search - using * as regex wildcard - only works in combination with a word \n",
    "- Limit search by year only appears after a search result. Setting a timeframe and removing the search term leads to results that are not specific to the term but the amount of results indicates that something is wrong. It might be that we only get a subset of results that include the removed search term but there is no indication for that. Nonetheless, this approach should be reviewed rigorously. \n",
    "    - 2001 till 2024 = 1 040 000 Results (0,04 Sec.)\n",

    "**Conclusion: <br>**\n",
    "It seems that 1 million and 1.5 million results are some sort of barrier. <br>\n",
    "If the search is to unspecific, the result is cut somewhere in this area. However, by choosing smaller timeframes, the results appear to be more reliable, Even though there is little to verify that. Searching with the wildcard \"*\" works as long as further constraints are used. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Possible solution: <br>**\n",
    "Search systematically by selecting only a subset of years in each search.\n",
    "If we are interested in very old documents, we could work with bigger timeframes, but in general, it seems like the amount of results per year is getting bigger the closer we get to the current year. This fits the expectations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Exploring alternatives: <br>**\n",
    "Using the Google Scholar API seems to be the better choice. However, getting all results without a search term persits as a challenge. \n",
    "Additionally the \"Free Plan\" provides only 100 searches / month even with 3 team members 300 searches / month might be problematic. \n",
    "\n",
    "Questions: \n",
